# Event bubbling and capturing 

bubbling : bubble always comes from inside to outside (from bottom to top in dom tree) --- event will be bubble from child to parent and then parent to grand parent --- >  (first child event will be fired then parent's event will be fired and at the end grand parent's event will be fired) 


capturing : it is completely opposite to the event bubbling. ---> events will be captured from top to bottom in dom tree . It is also called as event 'Trickling'. 

# example : element.addEventListener('click', ()=>{}, useCapture);

eventBubbling is used by default. 

first captuirng happens and then bubbling happens if we pass third parameter as true or false. --- > According to W3C School.
