  /*  
Asynchronous Programming : ---- 

JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it can execute one piece of code at a time. However, many operations—like network requests, file reading, or timers—are asynchronous, allowing the program to handle other tasks while waiting for these operations to complete.

Traditionally, asynchronous operations were handled using callbacks. While effective, callbacks can lead to "callback hell," making the code hard to read and maintain. Promises were introduced to address these challenges, offering a more elegant and manageable way to handle asynchronous operations. 

Promises :  ---- 
 
A Promise in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to attach callbacks to handle the outcome (success or failure) of that operation, without nesting callbacks.

A promise can be in one of three states:

Pending: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
Rejected: The operation failed.
Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, its state cannot change.
