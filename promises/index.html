  /*
  Asynchronous Programming : ----

  JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning it can execute one piece of code at a time. However, many operations—like network requests, file reading, or timers—are asynchronous, allowing the program to handle other tasks while waiting for these operations to complete.

  Traditionally, asynchronous operations were handled using callbacks. While effective, callbacks can lead to "callback hell," making the code hard to read and maintain. Promises were introduced to address these challenges, offering a more elegant and manageable way to handle asynchronous operations.

  Promises :  ----

  A Promise in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to attach callbacks to handle the outcome (success or failure) of that operation, without nesting callbacks.

  A promise can be in one of three states:

  Pending: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
  Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
  Rejected: The operation failed.
  Once a promise is fulfilled or rejected, its state cannot change.

  States of a Promise

  Pending: The operation is ongoing. For example, a network request has been sent, but the response hasn't arrived yet.
  Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully. For example, the network request received a response.
  Rejected: The operation failed. For example, the network request encountered an error.

    // any async operation
  });

    const data = "Sample data";
    const error = null;

    if (!error) {
      resolve(data); // fullfill the promise
    } else {
      reject("Error occured"); // reject the promise
    }
  });

  myPromise.then(
    (value) => {
      console.log("Fullfilled with", value);
    },
    (error) => {
      console.log("Rejected with", error); // this is not a good practice to provide second callback to handle errors, instead use catch
    }
  );

  myPromise
    .then((value) => {
      console.log("Fulfilled with:", value);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log("Rejected with:", error);

  chaining promises :

  The second .then() waits for fetchOrders to resolve and logs the orders.

  /* async await syntax 
    
    Introduced in ES2017, async and await are syntactic sugar over promises, making asynchronous code appear synchronous and easier to read. 

    an async function returns a promise. Inside an async function, you can use await to pause execution until a promise is settled.

  /* benefits of async await 
 Readability: Code reads top-to-bottom, similar to synchronous code.
`Error Handling: Use try...catch blocks for handling errors, which is more intuitive.
`Debugging: Easier to debug as the stack traces are cleaner.

  /* common mistakes with promises 

  1. Forgetting to return Promises in chains  -- If you don't return a promise inside a .then(), the next .then() may receive undefined. 
  */

  // incorrect code ---

  fetchData()
    .then((data) => {
      processData(data); // No return
    })
    .then((processed) => {
      console.log(processed); // undefined
    });

  // correct code ---

  fetchData()
    .then((data) => {
      return processData(data); // Return the promise
    })
    .then((processed) => {
      console.log(processed); // Processed data
    });

  /*
    
    2. Not handling all rejections --- 
    Failing to catch errors can lead to unhandled promise rejections, which may crash the application in some enviroments. So always attach a .catch() at the end of promise chains. 

    3. Mixing callbacks and promises improperly ---
    Combining callbacks with promises without proper handling can lead to unexpected behaviors.

   Solution: Stick to one approach. If using promises, avoid traditional callbacks   within them.
    
   4. Creating promises inside loops without proper handling --- 
   Creating multiple promises inside loops without managing their execution can cause performance issues or unexpected results. 
   Solution: Use Promise.all() or similar methods to handle multiple promises effectively. 

   5. Assuming promises are synchronous --- 

   Promises are asynchronous. Code after a promise runs immediately, not waiting for the promise to settle.
    */

  const promise = Promise.resolve("Done");
  console.log("Before");
  promise.then((msg) => console.log(msg));
  console.log("After");

  /*
  Promises revolutionized asynchronous programming in JavaScript by providing a cleaner, more manageable approach compared to traditional callbacks. They offer robust error handling, composability, and improved readability, especially when combined with async and await syntax.

Understanding promises is essential for modern JavaScript development, as they underpin many features and APIs, including fetch, async functions, and various libraries and frameworks. By mastering promises, you can write more efficient, readable, and maintainable asynchronous code.
